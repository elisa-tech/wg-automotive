# Autosar Requirements to OS - Analysis and Feedback
The Automotive WG considers Requirements the Autosar consortion poses on the underlying Operating system.
## Findings
The following points came up so far:
###   SWS_OSI_02000
Where does the number of ressource groups (8) come from?
###   RS_SAF_00001, RS_SAF_21202
Full time and data determinism is needed on system level, but not necessarily on OS level. We should discuss to what exactly the OS needs to provide to make fulfillment of the requirements possible.
